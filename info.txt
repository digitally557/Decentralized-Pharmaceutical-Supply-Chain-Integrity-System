Decentralized-Pharmaceutical-Supply-Chain-Integrity-System
Sector: Supply Chain

Concept Overview: Counterfeit drugs pose a significant threat to global public health. This system aims to ensure the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain by tracking drug batches from the point of manufacturing to the final pharmacy. Each stakeholder in the chain-manufacturer, distributor, pharmacist-records the transfer of the product, creating a transparent and verifiable trail that can be used to authenticate any drug package.

Stacks-Specific Implementation: Each batch of pharmaceuticals is tokenized at the source. Its journey through the supply chain is tracked via a series of transactions on the Stacks blockchain, which are settled on Bitcoin for maximum security. Clarity's post-conditions feature can be used to enforce regulatory compliance at the protocol level. For example, a contract could specify that a transfer transaction can only succeed if the sender is a verified, licensed distributor and the recipient is a licensed pharmacy, preventing diversion and ensuring only authorized entities handle the products.
