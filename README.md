# Decentralized Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Integrity System

## Overview

The Decentralized Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Integrity System is a blockchain-based solution designed to combat counterfeit drugs and ensure the integrity of pharmaceutical supply chains. This system leverages the Stacks blockchain and Bitcoin's security to create a transparent, verifiable trail for pharmaceutical products from manufacturing to final distribution.

## Problem Statement

Counterfeit drugs pose a significant threat to global public health. Traditional supply chain tracking methods are often fragmented, opaque, and vulnerable to manipulation. This system addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Transparency**: Complete visibility of drug movement through the supply chain
- **Authentication**: Verifiable proof of product authenticity
- **Compliance**: Protocol-level enforcement of regulatory requirements
- **Security**: Bitcoin-settled transactions for maximum security

## How It Works

### Core Concept

Each batch of pharmaceuticals is tokenized at the source (manufacturing). The journey through the supply chain is tracked via a series of transactions on the Stacks blockchain, creating an immutable record that can be used to authenticate any drug package.

### Key Features

1. **Tokenization**: Each pharmaceutical batch receives a unique digital token
2. **Supply Chain Tracking**: Every transfer between stakeholders is recorded
3. **Stakeholder Verification**: Only verified, licensed entities can participate
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Smart contracts enforce compliance at the protocol level
5. **Bitcoin Security**: All transactions are settled on Bitcoin for maximum security

### Stakeholders

- **Manufacturers**: Create and tokenize pharmaceutical batches
- **Distributors**: Licensed entities that transport products
- **Pharmacists**: Final point of sale, verify product authenticity
- **Regulators**: Monitor compliance and investigate issues

## Technical Implementation

### Stacks-Specific Features

- **Clarity Smart Contracts**: Enforce business logic and compliance rules
- **Post-conditions**: Ensure transactions meet regulatory requirements
- **Bitcoin Settlement**: Leverage Bitcoin's security for final transaction settlement

### Example Use Case

A smart contract could specify that a transfer transaction can only succeed if:
- The sender is a verified, licensed distributor
- The recipient is a licensed pharmacy
- All regulatory requirements are met

This prevents diversion and ensures only authorized entities handle pharmaceutical products.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) (Stacks development tool)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Decentralized-Pharmaceutical-Supply-Chain-Integrity-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Clarinet installation**:
   ```bash
   clarinet --version
   ```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage and cost analysis
npm run test:report

# Watch for changes and run tests automatically
npm run test:watch
```

### Smart Contract Development

1. **Create new contracts** in the `contracts/` directory
2. **Add contract configuration** to `Clarinet.toml`
3. **Write tests** in the `tests/` directory
4. **Run tests** to verify functionality

### Network Configuration

The project includes configuration for different networks:

- **Devnet**: Local development environment
- **Testnet**: Stacks testnet for testing
- **Mainnet**: Production Stacks network

Configuration files are located in the `settings/` directory.

## Usage

### For Developers

1. **Set up the development environment** following the installation instructions
2. **Implement smart contracts** in the `contracts/` directory
3. **Write comprehensive tests** for all contract functionality
4. **Deploy to testnet** for integration testing
5. **Deploy to mainnet** for production use

### For Stakeholders

1. **Manufacturers**: Deploy contracts to tokenize pharmaceutical batches
2. **Distributors**: Use the system to record product transfers
3. **Pharmacists**: Verify product authenticity before sale
4. **Regulators**: Monitor the system for compliance and investigate issues

## Security Considerations

- All transactions are cryptographically secured
- Smart contracts enforce business rules at the protocol level
- Bitcoin settlement provides additional security guarantees
- Only verified, licensed entities can participate in the supply chain
